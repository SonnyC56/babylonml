# Welcome to BabylonML!

**Build stunning 3D web experiences with the simplicity of HTML.**

BabylonML is a declarative, component-based framework built on top of the powerful [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) engine. It allows web developers to create complex 3D scenes using familiar HTML-like tags, abstracting away much of the boilerplate JavaScript typically required.

## Why BabylonML?

*   **Declarative:** Define your scene structure, entities, and their properties directly in HTML.
*   **Component-Based:** Attach reusable behaviors (like position, rotation, materials, lights, animations, sounds) to entities using simple attributes.
*   **Easy to Learn:** Leverages existing web development knowledge (HTML, CSS-like syntax for components).
*   **Powerful:** Harnesses the full rendering capabilities and features of Babylon.js.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly iterate on 3D ideas and build interactive experiences.
